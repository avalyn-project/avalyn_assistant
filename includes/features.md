# Avalyn Web UI
Avalyn has a built-in customizable light-weight HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) web system, which allows the self hosting of web pages within the Avalyn Framework.

`We have taken the liberty of creating the HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) virtual host files (WEB UI and RPC Client) you can find the virtual host configurations within the "includes" directory.`

`Edit the files however you need to, once you have set your virtual host files to fit your configurations, you can remove/delete the "includes" directory, it is not needed past this point.`

Which includes the following web based settings and configuration.

# Avalyn RPC Client

Some use cases include functions that are bound to the Avalyn Blockchain and the Avalyn Web UI.

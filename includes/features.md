# Avalyn Web UI
Avalyn has a built-in customizable light-weight HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) web system, which allows the self hosting of web pages within the Avalyn Framework.

`We have taken the liberty of creating the HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) virtual host files (WEB UI and RPC Client) you can find the virtual host configurations within the "includes" directory.`

`Edit the files however you need to, once you have set your virtual host files to fit your configurations, you can remove/delete the "includes" directory, it is not needed past this point.`

Which includes the following web based settings and configuration.

- - All support is truly appreciated.

#

# Avalyn RPC Client
With the features and commands listed above, there is still more, embedded within its coding is the Avalyn RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Client. Which in some cases allows users to communicate with Avalyn without Discord access, all securely processed client-side.

This light-weight RPC client allows ease of use, as it allows some functions to be operated outside of the Discord Framework.

Some use cases include functions that are bound to the Avalyn Blockchain and the Avalyn Web UI.


Avalyn RPC Usage Cases
-
This includes, but not limited to

- Genesis Block Creation. (/genesis)
- Avalyn Crypto Wallet Creation. (/wallet)
- Avalyn Blockchain Data. (/height, /blocks [Number Number])
- Stock or Cryptocurrency Price Checks. (/stock [Name/Ticker], /crypto [Name/Ticker])

# Upcoming Features
- - What we plan here, what we had planned, has evolved.
> The original plan was to simply create a Discord assistant that could help with moderation and organization of my own Discord server and channels.

> Then curiousity, of what I could do, what Avalyn could be.

With that in mind, if you have any questions or comments, you can contact us at contact@getavalyn.org

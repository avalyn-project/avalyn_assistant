# Avalyn Web UI
Avalyn has a built-in customizable light-weight HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) web system, which allows the self hosting of web pages within the Avalyn Framework.

`We have taken the liberty of creating the HTTP/HTTPS (SSL) virtual host files (WEB UI and RPC Client) you can find the virtual host configurations within the "includes" directory.`

`Edit the files however you need to, once you have set your virtual host files to fit your configurations, you can remove/delete the "includes" directory, it is not needed past this point.`

Which includes the following web based settings and configuration.

# Avalyn RPC Client
With the features and commands listed above, there is still more, embedded within its coding is the Avalyn RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Client. Which in some cases allows users to communicate with Avalyn without Discord access, all securely processed client-side.

This light-weight RPC client allows ease of use, as it allows some functions to be operated outside of the Discord Framework.

Some use cases include functions that are bound to the Avalyn Blockchain and the Avalyn Web UI.


Avalyn RPC Usage Cases
-
This includes, but not limited to

- Genesis Block Creation. (/genesis)
- Avalyn Crypto Wallet Creation. (/wallet)
- Avalyn Blockchain Data. (/height, /blocks [Number Number])
- Stock or Cryptocurrency Price Checks. (/stock [Name/Ticker], /crypto [Name/Ticker])


Updates to the
- Assistant application.
- RPC client.
- Web UI.

Are not only up to the creators and developers of the project. We encourage active bug reporting and overall development of commands, features, and functions of the Avalyn Discord Assistant application.

If this project becomes more than the intended “Discord” only application, we welcome that, we would like to give this project as much functionality as possible.
# Avalyn Plugins
Please keep in mind, with the moderation, we do not advise you to use accounts that have high priority or accounts that are “main accounts”, as most of the moderation with Twitter and Roblox accounts and groups moderation accounts are usually operated with accounts known as “Alternate Accounts”.

Avalyn Discord Assistant [Default] Configuration
-
- Requires a separate configuration section.

{ These brackets are required for the initial configuration.

	“token”: “Token_ID”,
	“prefix”: “/”,
	“clientId”: “Client_ID”.
	“guildId”: “Guild_ID”,

} Keep this set of brackets intact.

Avalyn Discord Assistant [Web] Configuration
-
- Requires a separate configuration section.

{ These brackets are not required for the initial configuration.

	“host”: “example.com”,
	“port”: “1280”,
	“rpc_host”: “rpc-client.example.com”,
	“rpc_port”: “1281”,
 
} These brackets can be removed as needed.

Avalyn Twitter Automation
-
- Will require Twitter/X Account Access.
- Requires a separate configuration section.

{ These brackets are not required for the initial configuration.

	“twitter_user”: “TwitterXUsername”,
	“twitter_pass”: “TwitterXPassword”,
 
} These brackets can be removed as needed.

Roblox Group Moderation
-
- Will require Roblox Account Access.
- Requires a separate configuration section.

{ These brackets are not required for the initial configuration.

	“rblx_user”: “RobloxianUsername”,
	“rblx_pass”: “RobloxianPassword”,
 
} <font style="color: red;">These brackets can be removed as needed.</font>

Side note to the users, Avalyn Discord Assistant tries to collect as little data as possible, focusing on a more user friendly and secure Discord user experience.

The only actual data that is used is the data within the configuration, even then it is only passed when it is required and only to the respective locations as needed.
